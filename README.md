# dog_breed_classifier

This repository contains the project file (dog_app.ipynb) submitted for the Udacity's Deep Learning course as part of their Machine Learning Nanodegree.  The project applies transfer learning using the ResNet50 model available in [Keras](https://keras.io/applications/#resnet50) to classify dog breeds. If the link .ipynb file above cannot be displayed on GitHub ((which seems to be a current issue)[https://github.com/iurisegtovich/PyTherm-applied-thermodynamics/issues/11]), the project file can also be viewed using (nbviewer)[https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/BlaneG/dog_breed_classifier/blob/master/dog_app.ipynb].  Please be patient as the large file takes a while to load.
